### Evening News
If i would try to get on the evening news i would take the difference
in the mean of the tow samples since it states that pregnancies for a
first child on average take about 13 hours longer.

### Sooth Patient
If i would try to sooth a patient i would show them that for all live birth the standard deviation is about 2.7 weeks so there is nothing wrong going on with their child.

### Precisely

Considering weather or not firstborn children cause a longer or shorter pregnancy period we found the following results. While the standard deviation for live births was around 2.7 weeks the difference
in the mean of the two groups (firstborn and others) is merely 13 hours. This also shows in Cohens Effect Size which reaches a merely 0.029 Standard diviations which is verly low for example the height differece between men and woman already lays at 1.7 standard deviations.
